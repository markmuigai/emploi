				Psychometric tests help to identify a candidate’s skills, knowledge and personality.
				They’re often used during the preliminary screening stage of candidates in recruitment or even while carrying out staff capacity assessment.

				Psychometric testing can measure a number of attributes including intelligence, critical reasoning, motivation and personality profile which will guide the organization in assigning roles.
			</p>
			<p>
				They’re objective, convenient and strong indicators of job performance; making them very popular with recruiters.

				We have sharpened our knowledge in psychometrics and taken a cutting-edge approach to assessments.
			</p>
			<p>
				We work hand-in-hand with workplace psychologists and other HR consultants to offer assessments that are increasingly varied, innovative and adapted to today’s needs.
