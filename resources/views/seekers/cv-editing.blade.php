                <p>The job market has become very competitive, and a single vacancy today may attract hundreds of applications.</p>
                <br>
				

				<p><b>What does that mean?</b></p>

				<p>A recruiter may spend as little as 20 seconds looking at each CV. You need to maximize on your 20 seconds to deliver maximum impression to the recruiter.</p>
				<br>

				<p>If you do not have the right skills to deliver a targeted, detailed and get concise CV, <a href="/contact">YOU NEED TO TALK TO THE EXPERTS</a>.</p>
				<br>

				<p>We leverage on our expertise to provide you with a clear, concise CV that matches your professional level and will stand out before recruiters.</p>
				<br>


				<b>PROCESS</b>:
				<br>

				<p>
					We first go through your CV to understand your professional journey and angle then send you a questionnaire which will ask you questions about your career goals and experiences. However, a personal consultation will be necessary for us to really get an idea of how to best market you to employers, so we will schedule an IN-DEPTH phone interview with one of our Certified Resume Writers to go over your questionnaire answers and make sure we know everything needed to make you stand out! (This is just one of the ways we are different from other firms).
				</p>
				<br>

				<p>

				We shall also be requesting for information we consider important that is missing from your CV. We will guide you in providing us with a career objective statement that is in line with your career goals but also with what most recruiters look out for especially in the line of finance and management.
				</p>
				<br>

				<p>
					We will then prepare a draft resume for your review. Quality is always most important and our process typically takes 2 â€“ 4 business days.
