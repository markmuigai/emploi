    	    	<p>
				IQ is a measure of your ability to reason and solve problems. It essentially reflects how well you did on a specific test as compared to other people of your age group. <br>
				While IQ can be a predictor of things such as innovation, experts caution that it does not necessarily guarantee success at the office. However, individuals with higher IQ levels have historically brought more meaningful change to
				organizations compared to their minors.
			   </p>
			   <p>Employers are advised to conduct IQ tests on candidates and employees to be in a better positioning when planning human resources
			  </p>

    	<li><b>Psychometric Tests</b></li>
    			<p>
				Psychometric tests help to identify a candidate’s skills, knowledge and personality.
				They’re often used during the preliminary screening stage of candidates in recruitment or even while carrying out staff capacity assessment.

				Psychometric testing can measure a number of attributes including intelligence, critical reasoning, motivation and personality profile which will guide the organization in assigning roles.
			</p>
			<p>
				They’re objective, convenient and strong indicators of job performance; making them very popular with recruiters.

				We have sharpened our knowledge in psychometrics and taken a cutting-edge approach to assessments.
			</p>
			<p>
				We work hand-in-hand with workplace psychologists and other HR consultants to offer assessments that are increasingly varied, innovative and adapted to today’s needs.
			</p>
		
    	<li><b>Proficiency-Tests</b></li>
    		 <p>Through this service you are able as employer to receive the test score for a candidate on the aptitude and proficiency tests. </p>
			 <p>You may also request for the administration of this on your own sourced candidates
			</p>
			<p>By administering proficiency tests on a candidate, the employer will be able to deeply analyze a candidate's strengths and weaknesses which may not be present in their resume.</p>
