                        Emploi Africa you have really nailed it from my gaps interval, my relieving work on short terms basis as this is where I gained so much of experience and responsibilities acquired.I take this opportunities to thank you once more. </p>

                        <p>I contacted Sophy back in August 2019 when I realized I needed a professional CV writer to revamp my CV since the one I previously used received very few call backs on job sites. Sophy immediately started working on it. She spent time above and beyond my expectation, going through my career history and prospective positions I envisaged, breaking down each role and key skills developed in each. Sophy does exactly what she says. She made sure I was informed every step of the way through constant communication via phone or email. After a couple of drafts I was presented with the final copy which I was extremely happy with. Absolutely worth the money! This CV received many hits from prospective employers and I finally secured a PhD position in Germany. I highly recommend Sophy to anyone not making progress in their job search in the current market.
